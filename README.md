## Fried Eggs
Fried Eggs are cracked open & cooked on a frying pan. They are traditionally eaten during breakfast and pair well with toast, bacon, steak, fried rice, and more! When ordering from a resturant or cooking them yourself, there are three main types of fried eggs to be aware of.  

Before frying your eggs, make sure your pan is well oiled or buttered to ensure the eggs don't stick! And don't be afraid to experiment by adding some herbs, light seasoning, or salt & pepper to give your eggs a little more flavor. 

#### **Sunny-Side Up**
An egg that is 'sunny-side up' is fried with the yolk facing upward and is not flipped. 
#### **Over-Easy**
An egg cooked over-easy is flipped when cooked and has a runny yolk. 
#### **Over-Medium**
An over-medium egg is also flipped, but the yolk is only slightly runny.

## Scrambled Eggs
Scrambled eggs are a typically served during breakfast. Before adding them onto a frying pan, the eggs are stirred/whipped together, combining both the yolk and eggs whites and giving the final cooked eggs a yellow color. Milk or cream is sometimes added to the eggs to make them more silky, along with some light seasoning or herbs for flavor. 

Scrambled Eggs can be eaten plain or have different toppings added to them to create an **omelet**! Omelets are one of the most common breakfast meals and can be found at almost any breakfast restaurant. Some common omelet additives include tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, onions, cheese, or different meats such as sausage, bacon, or ham.

## Boiled Eggs
Boiled eggs are the only types of eggs that are cooked with the shell on. They are placed in a pot of boiling hot water and are cooked for a certain time depending on how hard you'd like the yolk.  

#### **Hard Boiled**
Hard boiled have yolks that are completely cooked through, and they're typically left in the pot anywhere between 8-15 minutes. These eggs can be eaten by themselves but are also put in salads, sandwiches, or noodle dishes. 

#### **Soft Boiled**
In contrast to hard boiled eggs, the yolk in a soft boiled egg is runny. Timing is everything when it comes to cooking a soft boiled egg; you want to make sure the egg is still fully cooked but only to the point where the yolk is still a bit soft. Cooking time can range between 4-8 minutes, but it may take a few tries to find the texture of your liking. Soft boiled eggs are commonly eaten with toast (buttered or avocado toast) or noodle dishes such as ramen.

## Poached Eggs
Cooking poached eggs are probably the trickiest to get right. The process includes measuring the water level in the pot, adding a bit of vinegar, letting the water heat up to a simmer, creating a vortex by stirring the water, and finally dropping the unstirred egg in the middle of the vortex from above. The egg should stay intact and keep a round shape; after a few minutes, the egg is taken out with a sprainer spoon and put into an ice bath to cool. When cut, the final poached egg should have a runny yolk.  

Steak, toast, and the popular eggs-benedict entr√©e are some of the most common things poached eggs are eaten with.
